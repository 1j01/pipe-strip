Notice the center panel, how it is drawn without a border.
This framing, or indeed, lack of framing,
helps to underscore (or indeed, remove the scoring underneath, above, and to both sides of) Jon's loss of grounding — his world is shaken — and self-identity — it's almost an out of body experience — in that moment. It speaks to the theme of questioning reality itself. He has to look beyond — he has to! — to see, what it is that he's looking for — the pipe.

If we are to ask, "Now where could my pipe be?" it only makes sense to also ask, "Where could my pipe have been?"
Not just where is Jon's pipe, but where was Jon's pipe? Perhaps Jon inherited his pipe from his father.
The pipe is a symbol of his father.
Of generational wisdom. Pipes were used by the Native Americans in their peace ceremonies, and by the ancient Greeks in their sacred rituals.
They would share a pipe, and pass it around, and each person would take a puff, and then pass it on to the next person.
They would share stories, much like this one, of Jon, and his cat, Garfield... over a "good old smoke".

That bit about the ancient greeks and whatnot is speculative, or "not research", but nonetheless stands — in *full* force.
